# MoneyTransferDapp

A decentralized application (dApp) for transferring ETH, checking balances, and viewing transaction history, built with **Solidity** (smart contract) and **React** (frontend). Deployed on the Sepolia testnet, this is my first blockchain projectâ€”designed to be simple, functional, and beginner-friendly.
